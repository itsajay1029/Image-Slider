                <h2>Love</h2>
                <p>True love—that is, deep, abiding love that is impervious to emotional whims or fancy—is a choice.
                     It’s a constant commitment to a person regardless of the present circumstances.</p>

                <p>Cartoon is fun. Popeye, a pugnacious, wisecracking cartoon sailor who possesses
                     superhuman strength after ingesting an always-handy can of spinach.</p>

                <p>Developing a creative mind means allowing yourself to relax and think outside of the box. You can stimulate
                 creativity by setting aside time to brainstorm, breaking up your routine, and by seeking inspiration from people and places around you!</p>

                <h2>Death</h2>
                <p>When someone is dying, their heartbeat and blood circulation slow down. The brain and organs receive less oxygen than they 
                    need and so work less well. In the days before death, people often begin to lose control of their breathing.</p>

                    Hard work is about doing something that may not 
                    directly inspire you but that is necessary for you to achieve your goal.</p>
